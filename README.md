Josh: Changed struct PacketHeader to Packet. Completed SYN protocol handshake.

Kuan: Completed large file transfer over multiple packets and added stateflag states.

Both: Fixed file transfer for binary files by redoing send_packet.

Josh: Added poll(). Added timestamp interface. Created WindowFrame.  Started window[] array updating. Started timeout functionality based on window[].
